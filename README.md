# Acknowledgements
- Firstly:
      I would like to thank Geoff Gatward [GG] who patiently taught me much of what I know about Ansible and directed
      me to his playbooks https://github.com/ggatward/GG_Infra.git that I have based these playbooks on [sometimes plagiarised]
- Secondly:
      I would like to thank everyone that created roles that I utilise. These roles are listed in [roles/requirements.yml](roles/requirements.yml)
